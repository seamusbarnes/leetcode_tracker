# leetcode_tracker

Steps: 2. Download raw html from the Leetcode user progress history page(s) (https://leetcode.com/progress/)

    1. Develop html-parser to extract the following problem metadata


\*major caveat that coding is much more than solving Leetcode problems, but I like learning these patterns and they help me understand how simple but often beautiful algorithms work
